# JusticeBot

## Overview
**JusticeBot** is a lightweight legal assistant chatbot built to assist users with queries related to **Indian labor laws**. It takes one or more legal PDFs, breaks them into smaller parts, and uses AI to answer user questions based on that content. It works like a smart search engine with a chat interface, where users can ask questions and get accurate replies. The chatbot is built using modern tools like Streamlit (for the UI), FAISS (to store and search legal info), and advanced AI models from Hugging Face and Together.ai.
## Features
